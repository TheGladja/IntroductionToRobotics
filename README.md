 # Introduction to Robotics (2021 - 2022)
 Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Here I will post every homework and project covered by this course throughout the semester. Also, each material will be as perfectly structured as possible, that means including every detail about the subject (such as requirements, implementation details, code and image files) in order to make things more understandable. Give it a go!

 ## Homework 1

Coming soon...
